## Description
The JavaScript quiz page contains a section where the user enters their details: the name, class and admission number. After this there is a section that gives the user directions before proceeding to take the test. After the directions is the main section, the actual quiz. This section is composed of five questions each with multiple choices. After the user clicks the submit button, the web page calculates the score of the user based on the answers given. Each correct answer is worth 10 points hence the total is 50 points. The web page then displays the user's score as "You have scored x points".
